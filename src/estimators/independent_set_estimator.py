"""Estimator for sketches when using the independence assumption.

Under the independence assumption, the cardinality of the union of two
sketches representing sets A and B is equal to
   
  |A| + |B| - |A| * |B| / N,

where N is the size of the universe from which A and B are drawn.

  Given two sketches A and B representing samples drawn from a universe U,

  Note that the estimators for A and B will in general return cumulative histograms,
