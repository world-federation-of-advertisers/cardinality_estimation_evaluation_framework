    O(m) space-optimal algorithm for generating m random indices for list 
    of size n without replacement. NumPy's built-in choice function is slow when
    replace=False because it allocates n-sized arrays. This method is around 
    1000x faster for the sizes of n and m we are dealing with.
    
    Args:
      n: list or integer to choose from. If n is a list, this method will return
        values in n. If n is an integer, this method will return indices.
      m: Number of elements to choose.
      random_state: RandomState object to control randomness.
    
    Returns:
      List of elements chosen from n or list of indices from 0 (inclusive) to n (exclusive)
